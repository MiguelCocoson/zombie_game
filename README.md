# Overview

In this game you can are on a post-apocalyptic world with zombies. Use the right, left, up and down keys to move around the street.
You can shoot your weapon by clicking the left button of the mouse. Shoot and kill the zombies before they reach you.

I created this software for two reasons. I which to continue to develop this game further to become entretaining for people.
The secound reason is because I wanted to challange myself to create a game with GUI by myself.
